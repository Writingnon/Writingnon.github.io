<p>A young boy stood in front of the gates to the most prestigious magic academy in the entire continent, wearing his old and shabby brown jacket and green shorts. His green eyes glimmered like the stars as he took in the sight of his surroundings.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s amazing! It&#39;s exactly what you&#39;d expect from the Legendary Fairvax Academy!&quot;</p>
<p>Certainly, it was a sight you wouldn&#39;t expect to see in such a place. After all, the Academy was mostly attended by the nobility, with a lineage in magic that stretched all the way back to Yarza The First Wizard. A commoner like him had no place there.</p>
<p>And yet, there he was, standing in front of the open gates, gawking as other students walked past him.</p>
<p><em>Oh right I have to go! I have to meet with the headmaster before the entrance ceremony begins!</em></p>
<p>He broke out from his stupor, running lightly towards the academy grounds. He carried with him a simple sling bag, carrying only the bare necessities for him to stay here—mostly his clothes. As the son of a poor farmer, he had little money to spend on them. As such, even a small bag like his was enough to carry all the clothes he had.</p>
<p><em>Oh crap I don&#39;t know where the headmaster&#39;s office is, do I?</em></p>
<p>He stopped in the middle of an intersection. To his left were two tall buildings, about five story high. To his right was a small patch of flower fields, with a fountain in the middle. And on his front was a large singular building, taller than the other two.</p>
<p><em>Hmm, I guess I&#39;ll go to that building on the front. The tallest building has to be where the headmaster is!</em></p>
<p>With his cheerful step, the boy made his way to the building.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for him, it wasn’t where the headmaster was.</p>
<p>It was the women&#39;s dormitory instead.</p>
